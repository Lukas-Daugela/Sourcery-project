# Sourcery project

At the start of 2023 I finished "Sourcery" Academy for Front-end.<br>
There I was working with a team of 6 developers and built this beautiful project 😁<br>
My contribution to this project was not only coding but also creating custom SVG’s and “About Us”, "Questions" pages design using Figma.
